GrubStreet is the leading literary arts center in the country. We are a hardworking and creative bunch, and pride ourselves on a warm and supportive work environment. GrubStreet is seeking a Program Coordinator to join our team and help us run our Youth and Community program in advance of our transition to our new space in Boston’s Seaport neighborhood. This position will begin March 1, 2021.

The Program Coordinator will work closely with the Youth & Community Programs Manager and the Director of Community and Youth Programs to ensure smooth communications with a diverse pool of students and instructors, seamless enrollment processes for our classes, and will help maintain the high quality of our programming by administering and monitoring our class evaluation systems.

We work hard but we also encourage boldness, fun, and not taking ourselves too seriously. We hope the Program Coordinator is excited about joining the larger community of Grub writers in Boston.

We encourage BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and people of color), LGBTQIA+, people with disabilities, and other communities historically underrepresented in arts administration spaces to apply. GrubStreet strives to dismantle every system, process, or structure that would discourage any person from working with us.

ABOUT CURE ALZHEIMER’S FUND
Headquartered in Wellesley, Massachusetts, the Cure Alzheimer’s Fund team is comprised of mission-driven professionals who share a commitment to finding a cure, operate with the highest sense of integrity and collegiality, and continue to learn, adapt, and improve. This high-performing team has helped lead the organization to greater levels of success since its founding fifteen years ago. To date, Cure Alzheimer’s Fund has distributed over $115,000,000 to Alzheimer’s research, with many projects resulting in breakthroughs that afford a deeper understanding of Alzheimer’s disease to get closer to a cure.

There are currently 6 million people in the United States and 50 million worldwide who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Current estimates are that this represents 25% of the actual number of those afflicted; the others have not yet been diagnosed. Underrepresented racial groups and women are most at risk. Of those who have the disease, two-thirds are women. Black adults are twice as likely to get the disease as white adults, and the rate of the disease within the Latinx population is expected to grow by 7x in the next 30 years.

Recognizing that therapies are only possible when based on successful foundational research, board directors Henry McCance, Jeffrey and Jacqueline Morby, and Phyllis Rappaport formed Cure Alzheimer’s Fund in 2004 with an unwavering focus on providing research grants to the world’s leading scientists researching Alzheimer’s disease. The organization’s vision has been carefully and ambitiously designed to accelerate research, make bold bets, and eradicate Alzheimer’s disease.

The board of directors has also maintained a commitment to the organization itself by covering all operating expenses, ensuring that every dollar raised goes directly to support research initiatives.

ARL has animals of many types, breeds, sizes, ages, and temperaments at our adoption centers looking for permanent homes.
