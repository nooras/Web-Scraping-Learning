      "ABOUT CURE ALZHEIMER’S FUND\n",
      "Headquartered in Wellesley, Massachusetts, the Cure Alzheimer’s Fund team is comprised of mission-driven professionals who share a commitment to finding a cure, operate with the highest sense of integrity and collegiality, and continue to learn, adapt, and improve. This high-performing team has helped lead the organization to greater levels of success since its founding fifteen years ago. To date, Cure Alzheimer’s Fund has distributed over $115,000,000 to Alzheimer’s research, with many projects resulting in breakthroughs that afford a deeper understanding of Alzheimer’s disease to get closer to a cure.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are currently 6 million people in the United States and 50 million worldwide who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Current estimates are that this represents 25% of the actual number of those afflicted; the others have not yet been diagnosed. Underrepresented racial groups and women are most at risk. Of those who have the disease, two-thirds are women. Black adults are twice as likely to get the disease as white adults, and the rate of the disease within the Latinx population is expected to grow by 7x in the next 30 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recognizing that therapies are only possible when based on successful foundational research, board directors Henry McCance, Jeffrey and Jacqueline Morby, and Phyllis Rappaport formed Cure Alzheimer’s Fund in 2004 with an unwavering focus on providing research grants to the world’s leading scientists researching Alzheimer’s disease. The organization’s vision has been carefully and ambitiously designed to accelerate research, make bold bets, and eradicate Alzheimer’s disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "The board of directors has also maintained a commitment to the organization itself by covering all operating expenses, ensuring that every dollar raised goes directly to support research initiatives. \n",
